# FlowSoFine

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of FlowSoFine is to quickly and easily generate data structures
that make it easy to get statistical output starting from raw fcs-files
and a metadata table. The grid approach is especially useful if there
arenâ€™t any populations clearly visible in the files. This works with a
flexible amount of channels and correction for spatial dependencies.

## Installation

You can install the development version of FlowSoFine from GitHub with:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("JonasKup/FlowSoFine")
```

## Quickstart

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(FlowSoFine)
setwd("C:/Users/jonas/Documents/IUF/FACSDATA/testExp/fcs")


#for reading fcs files. Installation via Bioconductor.
library(flowCore)



#for community ecology statistics
library(vegan)
#> Loading required package: permute
#> Loading required package: lattice
#> This is vegan 2.5-6



fcs <- read.flowSet(pattern = ".fcs")
metadata <- read.csv2("metadata.csv")

#Create the FSFTemplate
ct <- FSFTemplate(flowset = fcs, channels = c("FSC PAR", "Hoechst Red"), resolution = 35)
#>  Processing sample 1 / 14 Processing sample 2 / 14 Processing sample 3 / 14 Processing sample 4 / 14 Processing sample 5 / 14 Processing sample 6 / 14 Processing sample 7 / 14 Processing sample 8 / 14 Processing sample 9 / 14 Processing sample 10 / 14 Processing sample 11 / 14 Processing sample 12 / 14 Processing sample 13 / 14 Processing sample 14 / 14

#plot the first sample of the CoreTemplate
plot(template = ct, sample = 1)
```

``` r

#Create a distance matrix with adjustments for spatial dependencies
distM <- weightedBray(ct)

#You can use the adonis function from the vegan package to get statistical output
adonis2(distM ~ treatment + age, data = metadata)
#> Permutation test for adonis under reduced model
#> Terms added sequentially (first to last)
#> Permutation: free
#> Number of permutations: 999
#> 
#> adonis2(formula = distM ~ treatment + age, data = metadata)
#>           Df SumOfSqs      R2      F Pr(>F)
#> treatment  1  0.09713 0.07966 0.8612  0.641
#> age       10  0.89666 0.73536 0.7950  0.844
#> Residual   2  0.22556 0.18499              
#> Total     13  1.21935 1.00000
