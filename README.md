The goal of FlowSoFine is to …

## Installation

``` r
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(FlowSoFine)
#> Warning: replacing previous import 'data.table::last' by 'dplyr::last' when
#> loading 'FlowSoFine'
#> Warning: replacing previous import 'data.table::first' by 'dplyr::first' when
#> loading 'FlowSoFine'
#> Warning: replacing previous import 'data.table::between' by 'dplyr::between'
#> when loading 'FlowSoFine'
#> Warning: replacing previous import 'dplyr::filter' by 'flowCore::filter' when
#> loading 'FlowSoFine'
#> Warning: replacing previous import 'ggplot2::last_plot' by 'plotly::last_plot'
#> when loading 'FlowSoFine'
#> Warning: replacing previous import 'flowCore::filter' by 'plotly::filter' when
#> loading 'FlowSoFine'
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub\!
